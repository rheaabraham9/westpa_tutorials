# WESTPA runs this script for each trajectory segment. WESTPA supplies
# environment variables that are unique to each segment, such as:
#
#   WEST_CURRENT_SEG_DATA_REF: A path to where the current trajectory segment's
#       data will be stored. This will become "WEST_PARENT_DATA_REF" for any
#       child segments that spawn from this segment
#   WEST_PARENT_DATA_REF: A path to a file or directory containing data for the
#       parent segment.
#   WEST_CURRENT_SEG_INITPOINT_TYPE: Specifies whether this segment is starting
#       anew, or if this segment continues from where another segment left off.
#   WEST_RAND16: A random integer
#
# This script has the following three jobs:
#  1. Create a directory for the current trajectory segment, and set up the
#     directory for running pmemd/sander 
#  2. Run the dynamics
#  3. Calculate the progress coordinates and return data to WESTPA


# If we are running in debug mode, then output a lot of extra information.
if [ -n "$SEG_DEBUG" ] ; then
